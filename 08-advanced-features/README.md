# Advanced Features

Here we show the remaining advanced features we can use to build apps.

* Using data structures like queues and sets.
* Using `Tick` to handle delayed actions (deduct this in 10 blocks)
* Modifying the validator set (basic staking idea)
* App -> App permissioning with IBC (account using roles)
* And more...

This is kind of the grab-bag for advanced users to see what is possible with
this system.
